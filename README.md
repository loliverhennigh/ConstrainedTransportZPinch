# ConstrainedTransportZPinch

Very simple Ideal MHD simulation of shear flow stabilized Z-pinch implemented in (JAX)
This code was modified from the 2D MHD code by Philip Mocz (2023), [here](git@github.com:loliverhennigh/ConstrainedTransportZPinch.git)
A video of the results can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADio_yOoKkw). I used slightly incorrect initial pressure for the video though and the code here contains the fix.
